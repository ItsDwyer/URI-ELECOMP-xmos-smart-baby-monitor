``lib_mic_array`` is a library for interfacing with one or more PDM microphones
on an XMOS device. 

Version 5 of this library has been redesigned from scratch to make efficient
usage of the XMOS XS3 architecture. (Note that version 5 does not support XS2 or
XS1 devices)

See :ref:`getting_started` to get going.
